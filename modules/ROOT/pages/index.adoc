= Server API
:page-no-toc: true

The Teak Server API allows you to communicate directly with the Teak server, making it easy to handle tasks from your backend rather than the client. Here you’ll find everything you need to manage notifications, handle rewards, track purchases, and maintain player data.

== First Steps

1. To start offering in-game rewards → xref:server-api::page$rewards/endpoint.adoc[**Implement Teak Reward Endpoint**]
2. Schedule certain Notification sends from your game server → xref:server-api::page$notifications/v2_schedule.adoc[**API Driven Notification Sends**]
3. Give your CRM's more tools for personalization → xref:server-api::page$other/v2_player_properties.adoc[**Integrate Player Properties**]

Once you’ve set up these core features, move on to managing communication preferences, purchase tracking, and more advanced player data tasks. If you need help xref:ROOT::page$support.adoc[*reach out for support*].
