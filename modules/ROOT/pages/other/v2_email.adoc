Description: The `v2/email` endpoint allows for server side modification of player email addresses. For example, this API can be connected to your internal administrative tools to ensure that the email address Teak has on file for a player is promptly updated in response to any modifications made in your internal administrative tools.

Please be aware that Teak enforces that each player may only have a single email address, and each email address may only belong to a single player. The response to this API will inform you of the actions Teak took in order to preserve these invariants while making the requested change.
