= Exclusion Management

An exclusion is an (optionally time limited) request to cease all marketing communication to a player. In response to an exclusion request, Teak will purge all methods Teak has of reaching a player, including push tokens, email address, and advertising identifiers. Until the exclusion is deleted or expires, Teak will not record any methods of reaching a player. Once an exclusion is deleted or expires, Teak will record methods of reaching a player, however previously known player contact methods will not be restored.

Other player opt out preferences are not impacted by an exclusion.
