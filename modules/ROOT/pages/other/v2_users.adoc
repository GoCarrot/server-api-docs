= Player Removal
:endpoint: v2/users

From time to time a player may request that all of their data be deleted. The DELETE `{endpoint}` endpoint will remove all information Teak has about a player, while retaining anonymized usage data so that metrics such as daily active users and revenue may still be properly calculated. Data removal is complete immediately upon receiving a response from this endpoint, and cannot be undone.
