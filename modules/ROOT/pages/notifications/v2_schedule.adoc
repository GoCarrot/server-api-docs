Description: The `v2/schedule` endpoint allows for bulk scheduling of notifications to be delivered within 30 days. Before using this API you must configure a corresponding xref:usage::scheduling.adoc#_local[Local Schedule, window=_blank] on the https://app.teak.io/login[Teak Dashboard, window=_blank]. Doing so gives you the full benefit of Teak’s analytics, A/B testing, and Content Management System when using local notifications.

The `Name` you give the Schedule is `notification_identifier` you should use in calls to this API. Your marketing team may already have set up some Local Schedules; be sure to ask them if they have and what names they’ve given the Local Schedules.

This endpoint is appropriate for use when users whom the notification should be sent to change frequently or when notifications need to be sent to different users at different times.
